# **AI-Powered Nutrition Coach**

**Project Proposal**

---

## **1. Problem Statement**

Poor dietary habits and nutrient deficiencies are major contributors to lifestyle diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. Many individuals struggle to select meals that align with their health conditions, fitness goals, and dietary preferences. While numerous nutrition apps exist, most lack:

* True personalization based on medical and fitness profiles.
* Accurate food logging tools that are quick and user-friendly.
* Real-time nutrient gap feedback and adaptive recommendations.
* Cultural and regional food inclusivity.

This project proposes the development of an **AI-powered nutrition coach** that integrates multiple nutrition databases, speech-to-text logging, and machine learning personalization to deliver **scientifically accurate, culturally relevant, and user-specific meal plans**.

---

## **2. Research Questions**

1. How can AI algorithms integrate health profiles, fitness goals, and dietary preferences to generate nutritionally balanced and medically appropriate meal plans?
2. What is the accuracy and usability of speech-to-text food logging compared to manual entry, and how can it be optimized to correctly interpret portion sizes and mixed meals?
3. To what extent can AI recommendations improve macro-nutrient balance (carbs, protein, fats) and correct micronutrient deficiencies over time?
4. How does customizing recipes to match cultural and regional food preferences affect adherence to healthy eating plans?
5. How can data from multiple nutrition sources (Edamam, USDA) be standardized to ensure consistent nutrient analysis?
6. What impact does personalized meal timing have on user performance, recovery, and weight management?
7. How effective is real-time nutrient feedback in promoting sustainable healthy eating behaviors and improving biomarkers such as BMI, cholesterol, and blood sugar?

## **3. Research Objectives**

1. **Develop** an AI-based nutrition recommendation system that personalizes meal plans according to user health profiles, fitness goals, and dietary preferences.
2. **Evaluate** the accuracy and usability of speech-to-text food logging for rapid and convenient meal tracking.
3. **Optimize** macro- and micronutrient intake through targeted AI recommendations addressing deficiencies and excesses.
4. **Investigate** how cultural and regional recipe customization affects adherence to nutrition plans.
5. **Ensure** consistency and accuracy of nutrient data through integration and standardization of multiple nutrition APIs.
6. **Assess** the effect of AI-recommended meal timing on performance, energy levels, and weight management.
7. **Measure** the long-term impact of nutrient feedback on dietary behavior and health biomarkers.

## **4. Research Hypotheses**

**H1:** AI-generated meal plans tailored to individual health conditions and goals will achieve higher nutritional adequacy than generic meal plans.
**H2:** Speech-to-text food logging will achieve ≥90% accuracy compared to manual entry.
**H3:** AI-driven recommendations will improve macro-nutrient balance and reduce micronutrient deficiencies within 8 weeks.
**H4:** Cultural customization will increase dietary adherence rates by at least 20%.
**H5:** API data standardization will reduce nutrient reporting discrepancies to less than ±5%.
**H6:** Personalized meal timing will improve self-reported energy and recovery scores.
**H7:** Continuous nutrient feedback will result in measurable improvements in BMI, cholesterol, and blood sugar over 12 weeks.

## **5. Technology Stack**

* **Frontend:** Streamlit (rapid prototyping) / React (future web app)
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
* **Database:** MySQL (user profiles, logs)
* **APIs:**

  * Edamam Recipe Search API (recipes & nutrition)
  * USDA FoodData Central API (detailed nutrient data)
  * Google Speech-to-Text API (voice-based logging)
  * OpenAI API / Local ML model (recommendations)
* **Visualization:** Plotly (charts & nutrient trends)
* **Cloud & Hosting:** Google Cloud (ETL & storage), Vercel (frontend), Docker for deployment

---

## **6. Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1 – Setup**

* Acquire API keys (Edamam, USDA, Google Speech-to-Text).
* Build Python backend with FastAPI.
* Create basic Streamlit frontend with user login.

**Phase 2 – Meal Plan & Logging**

* Integrate Edamam API for meal generation.
* Integrate USDA API for nutrition lookup.
* Implement text-based logging and nutrient calculation.

**Phase 3 – Voice Input**

* Integrate Google Speech-to-Text API.
* Process voice logs → text → nutrient breakdown.

**Phase 4 – Dashboard**

* Store logs in MySQL and CSV backups.
* Build nutrient charts (macros, vitamins, minerals).
* Set up deficiency/excess alerts.

**Phase 5 – AI Personalization**

* Train AI logic to suggest meals filling nutrient gaps.
* Add lifestyle tips (hydration, meal timing, snacks).

**Phase 6 – ETL Pipeline & Cloud Storage**

* Automate extraction from APIs, transformation, and loading into cloud database.
* Enable analytics queries for long-term tracking.

---

## **7. Expected Outcomes**

* **User Experience:** Seamless, voice-enabled meal logging system.
* **Nutrition Accuracy:** Reliable macro- and micronutrient tracking from multiple sources.
* **Personalization:** AI-driven recommendations tailored to health goals and conditions.
* **Engagement:** Improved adherence to healthy eating through culturally relevant meals.
* **Impact:** Measurable improvements in key health markers over time.
